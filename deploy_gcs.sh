# deploy_gcs supports deploying build artifacts to GCS buckets using service
# account keys from the environment, such as those stored in travis-ci.
#
# Examples:
#   # Copies all files matching pattern to the named folder, preserving names.
#   deploy_gcs.sh SERVICE_ACCOUNT_mlab_sandbox \
#       build/*.rpm \
#       gs://example-mlab-sandbox/files/
#
#   # Copies specific file to a folder, preserving the name.
#   deploy_gcs.sh SERVICE_ACCOUNT_mlab_sandbox \
#       build/foobar.rpm \
#       gs://example-mlab-sandbox/files/
#
#   # Copies specific file and renames it in GCS.
#   deploy_gcs.sh SERVICE_ACCOUNT_mlab_sandbox \
#       build/foobar.rpm \
#       gs://example-mlab-sandbox/files/foobar-newname.rpm
