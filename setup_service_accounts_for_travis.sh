#
# setup_service_accounts_for_travis.sh will create service accounts (if missing),
# encode service account credentials (if missing), and set travis environment
# variables to contain the encoded service account credentials so they are
# available for travis `deploy` scripts.
#
# By default, setup_service_accounts_for_travis.sh creates service accounts in
# the standard four projects: mlab-sandbox, mlab-staging, and mlab-oti. If you
# wish to additionally create a service account in the mlab-testing project,
# pass a single parameter, 'mlab-testing'.
#
# In order to perform GCP operations from travis, we must have service account
# credentials available to travis. This script will create service account
# credentials for all three M-Lab projects with a name derived from the git
# repository (to help trace bad behavior back to the source).
#
# To create a service account we must assigning it a role. Since IAM Roles are
# in flux, this script assigns a default minimal-permission role. The user must
# manually create or assign a custom role through the GCP console.
#
# The default role: cloud-storage-deployer
#
# You may assign other custom roles to your service account in GCP Console:
#
#    GCP Console -> IAM & admin -> IAM
#    Select the drop down next to the service account.
#    Look for Custom -> and choose a custom role.
#
# DO NOT ASSIGN standard roles to deployment service accounts. They are almost
# certainly overly permissive.
